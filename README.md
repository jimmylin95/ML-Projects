# Machine Learning Projects

A reprository of my attempts at different types of machine learning projects

At the moment, I'm going to start playing around with the 'hello world' of CV, MNIST and CIFAR10.

The following types of Algorithms will be added:

Regression:
- Random Forest
- Ridge and Lasso regulaizers
- Boosting and Bagging

Clustering:
- K means
- Hierarchical clustering
- EM Algorithm
- K Nearest Neighbors

Dimensionality Reduction:
- PCA
- LCA
